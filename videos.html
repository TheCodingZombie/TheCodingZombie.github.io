                    This was the first ever video I did for my friend, Qatsoup!
                    <br>It's a fast-paced compilation of their best moments while playing in an online Splatoon Tournament!

                    This is also a compilation of their best moments, simply playing scrims against some other Splatoon Teams!
                    <br>I'd like to say this is a more refined version of the first video I did for them, with much better edits and memes.

                    My most recent video, and the one that reflects my current style the best!
                    <br>While this may look different from the rest due to my avatar changing, it's still very similar in style to the rest of the videos I've made.

                    My first game review, and one of the longest and most polished videos I've ever done!
                    <br>It features both detailed information on what the game is and why one should try it,
                    <br>as well as my own opinions of the game and analyzing its design in a more meta sense.
