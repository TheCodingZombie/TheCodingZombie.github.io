        <div class="box">
            <p>I'm TheSocialZombie or simply Zombie!
                <br>I'm an aspiring game dev who also dabbles in digital art, video editing/production, and music!
                <br>I am going to college in America for my degree in Computer Science, and this website was created to show off some of my skills!
                <br><br>From the very start, I have had a fascination in how video games function and how they are made.
                <br>My father introduced me to coding as a child and I have stayed with it ever since!
                <br><br>I primarily code in Godot, though I have experience with Unity and Unreal as well!
                <br>I also have experience in languages like Python, Java, C++, and more!
                <br><br>If you'd like to reach out, I have several places you can find me in the linktree below!
                <br>Thanks for reading!
