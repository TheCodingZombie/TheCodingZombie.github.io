                    PMCSBalatro, more commonly referred to as ColorSplashed, is a mod for the popular roguelike game, Balatro.
                    <br>It adds several new Jokers based on Paper Mario: Color Splash's enemies, as well as various other features.
                    <br>You can find all the new features in its public repository!
                    <br><br>As Balatro is a game entirely coded in Lua, so too was this mod.
                    <br>This mod allowed me to learn Lua and feel comfortable with its syntax, all while giving my favorite game a fresh coat of paint!

                    Plant Sitters will be a mobile idle game, revolving around taking care of your own plants as well as taking care of other people's plants for money.
                    <br>It has plans for different plant types, a shop system, and various passive abilities that your own plants give your garden!
                    <br>It is meant to be a relaxing experience. Something you check in daily for a few minutes on your commute to work or school.
                    <br><br>While Plant Sitters is currently in hiatus, it will be returning to development once I finish War and Pieces and learn more about Godot!

                    Typing Tutor was a C++ Project that would teach you how to type.
                    <br>It functioned entirely in the command line, but has its own rudimentary text-based UI.
                    <br>It featured a large dictionary of words and allowed you to practice typing by spelling out those words.
                    <br>You could either practice with some commonly mispelled words, or you could practice with any word from the dictionary!
                    <br>It also allowed you to search for a word from said dictionary.
                    <br><br>This project was meant to demonstrate file usage in C++ as well as binary search algorithms.
                    <br>This project is just a showcase and will not be updated further.
